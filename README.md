popHealth-Ember
===============

This is a re-implementation of the [popHealth](https://github.com/pophealth/pophealth) client side, using Ember instead of Thorax. It's built on top of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and the [Yeoman Ember generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember). Basic installment looks like this (and requires Node and Ruby):

    npm install -g yo
    gem install compass
    cd brigade_frontend
    npm install
    bower install

Once you've installed it, you can run it locally via `grunt serve`.
